NOTE: This version is patched by AzureGem (rreminy) to apply patches from brianide, uwx, mixels and my own. The patches are the following:
- brianide: Added smart cursor interaction flag.
- brianide: Added item and recipe OnCraft hooks.
- uwx: Additional station slots. (total 15 slots)
- mixels: Fixes search capitalization bug, searches are now case insensitive.
- rreminy: 5 additional station slots and modified the GUI to fit all 20 slots.
- rreminy: Fxed 2 array out of bounds errors, allowing MS to be updated in place without starting a new world. (Warning: downgrading will make you lose the additional station slots irrecoverably)
- rreminy: Version downed to 0.0.0.1 (I mistakenly upped it to 0.4.3.2 previously, I don't want this to conflict with future releases)

Are you tired of having a mess of chests in your base? Never remember where you put your items, and have to run across your entire house to get from chest to chest? This mod will solve all of your problems!

This mod offers a solution to storage problems once and for all. It allows you to construct a central network to store all your items, that you can access from one single block. If desired, you can even set up multiple access points to use your storage from anywhere in the world. You can search your storage for items with a certain name, filter by item types, etc. The magic storage can even craft items for you!

The magic storage scales as you progress in your playthrough. It is accessible very early in the game, but with limited power. As you defeat bosses and earn more materials, you will be able to upgrade your storage to perform more functions and more easily expand the storage capacity.
